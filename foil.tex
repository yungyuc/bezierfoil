Terminology used for defining the airfoil:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Chord ($c$)
    \item
    Maximum camber ($m$)
    \item
    Maximum camber location ($p$)
    \item
    Maximum thickness ($h$)
    \item
    Camber line (red dashed line)
    \item
    Leading edge ($x = 0, y = 0$)
    \item
    Trailing edge ($x = c, y = 0$)
\end{enumerate}

The wing profile is defined by four-digit ($\mathrm{XYZZ}$):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    The 1st digit is the maximum camber as percentage of the chord.
    \begin{equation*}
        m = c \times (\mathrm{X} / 100)
    \end{equation*}
    \item
    The 2nd digit is the maximum camber location in tenths of the chord.
    \begin{equation*}
        p = c \times (\mathrm{Y} / 10)
    \end{equation*}
    \item
    The last two digits are the maximum thickness as percent of the chord.
    \begin{equation*}
        h = c \times (\mathrm{ZZ} / 100)
    \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

The formula to calculate the thickness is
\begin{equation*}
    y_h = 5h \left( 0.2969\sqrt{x} - 0.1260x - 0.3516x^2 + 0.2843x^3 - 0.1015x^4 \right)
\end{equation*}
where $x$ is the position along the chord (from $0$ to $1$), $y_h$ is the half thickness at a given value of $x$, and
$h$ is the maximum thickness.

The camber line equation is
\begin{equation*}
    y_c =
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{m}{p^2} (2px - x^2); & 0 \leq x \leq p \\
        \frac{m}{(1 - p)^2} (1 - 2p + 2px - x^2); & p \leq x \leq 1
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $y_c$ is the camber line point at a given value of $x$, $m$ is the maximum camber, and $p$ is the location of
maximum camber.

The point $\mathbf{F}_u(x)$ in upper surface equation is
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{F}_u(x) =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x_u \\ y_u
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x - y_h \sin\theta \\ y_c + y_h \cos\theta
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{e:naca:up_xy}
\end{equation}
and the point $\mathbf{F}_l(x)$ in lower surface equation is
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{F}_l(x) =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x_u \\ y_u
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x + y_h \sin\theta \\ y_c - y_h \cos\theta
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
    \arctan \theta =
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{2m}{p^2} (p - x); & 0 \leq x \leq p \\
        \frac{2m}{(1 - p)^2} (p - x); & p \leq x \leq 1
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

The basis functions for an $n$th degree Bezier curve are expressed as a linear combination of Bernstein basis
polynomials of degree $n$.

\begin{figure}[h!]

The items of Bernstein basis polynomials of degree $n$ are defined as
\begin{equation}
    b_{m, n}(t) = {n \choose m} t^m (1 - t)^{n - m}
    \label{e:cbc:bbp}
\end{equation}
where ${n \choose m}$ is a binomial coefficient and $m = 0, 1, \dots, n$. The Bernstein basis polynomials have the
following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    $b_{m, n}(t) = 0$, if $m < 0$ or $m > n$.
    \item
    $b_{m, n}(t) \geq 0$, for $t \in [0, 1]$.
    \item
    $b_{m, n}(1 - t) = b_{n - m, n}(t)$.
\end{enumerate}
The cubic Bezier curve is defined by 4 control points $\mathbf{P}_i$, $i = 0, 1, 2, 3$:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{P}_i =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        P_{xi} \\ P_{yi}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
The function $\mathbf{B}(t)$ is
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{B}(t) = \Sigma b_{i, 3}(t)\mathbf{P}_i
\end{equation*}
where $b_{i, 3}(t)$ is shown in Eq.~(\ref{e:cbc:bbp}). This function can be expanded to
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{B}(t) = (1 - t)^3 \mathbf{P}_0 + 3(1 - t)^2 t \mathbf{P}_1 + 3(1 - t) t^2 \mathbf{P}_2 + t^3 \mathbf{P}_3
    \label{e:cbc:der0}
\end{equation}
where $0 \leq t \leq 1$. The first-order derivative of $\mathbf{B}(t)$ is
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{B}^\prime(t) = 3 \left[
        (1 - t)^2 (\mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_0) +
        2(1 - t)t (\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) +
        t^2 (\mathbf{P}_3 - \mathbf{P}_2)
    \right]
\end{equation*}
The second-order derivative of $B(t)$ is
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{B}^{\prime \prime}(t) = 6 \left[
        (1 - t)(\mathbf{P}_2 - 2\mathbf{P}_1 + \mathbf{P}_0) + t(\mathbf{P}_3 - 2\mathbf{P}_2 + \mathbf{P}_1)
    \right]
\end{equation*}

For a sequence of $n$ cubic Bezier curves, $\mathbf{B}_0(t)$ through $\mathbf{B}_{n - 1}(t)$, there are $4n$ control
points can be adjusted. It implies that there are $4n$ dimensions of freedom. Assume the first and last points are
fixed. If we wish the value, slope, and curvature between any two Bezier curves are continuous, the degree of freedom
will become $n+1$. Thus, we can keep the continuous value of curvature when adding the number of Bezier curves.

\chapter{Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm}
% ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LM) is used to solve non-linear least squares problems, especailly for curve fitting. The
LM combines Gauss-Newton algorithm and gradient descent algorithm. It can find the solution efficiently even if the
initial point is set undesirably.

For a non-linear least squares curve fitting problem, the sum of the squares of the deviations $S(\beta)$ is
\begin{equation}
    \label{e:lm:sd}
    S(\beta) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \left| y_i - f(x_i, \beta) \right|^2
\end{equation}
where $f(x, \beta)$ is a curve function, and $(x_i, y_i)$ is a set of $N$ empirical pairs. To replace $\beta$ with
$\beta + \delta$, the function $f(x_i, \beta + \delta)$ is approximated by linearization
\begin{equation}
    f(x_i, \beta + \delta) \approx f(x_i, \beta) + J_i \delta
    \label{e:lm:f_apx}
\end{equation}
where $J_i$ is the gradient of $f$ with respect to $\beta$
\begin{equation*}
    J_i = \frac{\partial f(x_i, \beta)}{\partial \beta}
\end{equation*}
To get the $S(\beta + \delta)$, substitute Eq.~(\ref{e:lm:f_apx}) into Eq.~(\ref{e:lm:sd}) in vector notation
\begin{equation*}
    S(\beta + \delta) \approx \left| \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{f}(\beta) - \mathbf{J} \mathbf{\delta} \right|^2
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf{J}$ is the Jacobian matrix, whose $i$th row is $J_i$. Set the derivative of $S(\beta + \delta)$ with
respect to $\delta$ as zero to get the solution for minimizing $S(\beta + \delta)$
\begin{equation*}
    \left( \mathbf{J}^\top \mathbf{J} \right) \mathbf{\delta} =
    \mathbf{J}^\top \left[ \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{f}(\beta) \right]
\end{equation*}
Levenberg adds a damping term to make it become
\begin{equation*}
    \left( \mathbf{J}^\top \mathbf{J} + \lambda \mathbf{I} \right) \mathbf{\delta} =
    \mathbf{J}^\top \left[ \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{f}(\beta) \right]
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix. And the $\delta$ can be sloved as
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\delta} =
    \left( \mathbf{J}^\top \mathbf{J} + \lambda \mathbf{I} \right)^{-1}
    \mathbf{J}^\top \left[ \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{f}(\beta) \right]
    \label{e:lm:sol}
\end{equation}
If $\lambda \rightarrow 0$, the LM becomes Gauss-Newton algorithm. And, if $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$, the LM becomes
gradient descent algorithm.

$\nu$ is a constant greater than 1.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Linear least squares (LLS) is a set of formulations for solving statistical problems involved in linear regression,
including variants for ordinary, weighted, and generalized residuals.

Consider the linear equation
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}
    \label{e:lls:leq}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$. When $m > n$, $\mathbf{x} \in
\mathbb{R}^n$ is the solution of
\begin{equation*}
    \underset{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n}{\text{minimize}} \left| \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b} \right|^2
\end{equation*}
$\mathbf{x}$ can be computed by
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{A}^\top \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}^* = \mathbf{A}^\top \mathbf{b}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{x}^* = (\mathbf{A}^\top \mathbf{A})^{-1} \mathbf{A}^\top \mathbf{b}
    \label{e:lls:sol}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{A}^\top$ denotes the transpose of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}^*$ is the projection of
$\mathbf{b}$ in columnn space of $\mathbf{A}$.

\chapter{Fit Airfoil with Cubic Bezier Curve}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We define a function $S(\mathbf{P})$ as the sum of distance between cubic Bezier curve point $\mathbf{B}(t_i,
\mathbf{P})$ and 4-digut NACA airfoil point $\mathbf{F}(x_i)$:
\begin{equation*}
    S(\mathbf{P}) =
    \sum_{i = 1}^N \left| \mathbf{F}(x_i) - \mathbf{B}(t_i, \mathbf{P}) \right|^2 =
    \left[ \mathbf{F} - \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{P}) \right]^\top \left[ \mathbf{F} - \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{P}) \right]
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf{F}$ is:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{F} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x_0 \\ y_0 \\ x_1 \\ y_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_{N - 1} \\ y_{N - 1}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are $x_u(x_i)$ and $y_u(x_i)$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:naca:up_xy}). And then, $\mathbf{P}$ and
$\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{P})$ are:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{P} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        P_{x0} \\ P_{y0} \\ P_{x1} \\ P_{y1} \\ P_{x2} \\ P_{y2} \\ P_{x3} \\ P_{y3}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{P}) =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Sigma b_{i, 3}(t_0)P_{xi} \\
        \Sigma b_{i, 3}(t_0)P_{yi} \\
        \Sigma b_{i, 3}(t_1)P_{xi} \\
        \Sigma b_{i, 3}(t_1)P_{yi} \\
        \vdots \\
        \Sigma b_{i, 3}(t_{N - 1})P_{xi} \\
        \Sigma b_{i, 3}(t_{N - 1})P_{yi} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Here, we fix $\mathbf{P}_0$ and $\mathbf{P}_3$ at leading edge and trailing edge. By keeping $S(\mathbf{P})$,
$\mathbf{B}(t_i, \mathbf{P})$, $\mathbf{P}$, and $\mathbf{F}(x_i)$ can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{F} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x_0 - b_{0, 3}(t_0)P_{x0} - b_{3, 3}(t_0)P_{x3} \\
        y_0 - b_{0, 3}(t_0)P_{y0} - b_{3, 3}(t_0)P_{y3} \\
        x_1 - b_{0, 3}(t_1)P_{x0} - b_{3, 3}(t_1)P_{x3} \\
        y_1 - b_{0, 3}(t_1)P_{y0} - b_{3, 3}(t_1)P_{y3} \\
        \vdots \\
        x_{N - 1} - b_{0, 3}(t_{N - 1})P_{x0} - b_{3, 3}(t_{N - 1})P_{x3} \\
        y_{N - 1} - b_{0, 3}(t_{N - 1})P_{y0} - b_{3, 3}(t_{N - 1})P_{y3}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{P} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        P_{x1} \\ P_{y1} \\ P_{x2} \\ P_{y2}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{P}) =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        b_{1, 3}(t_0)P_{x1} + b_{2, 3}(t_0)P_{x2} \\
        b_{1, 3}(t_0)P_{y1} + b_{2, 3}(t_0)P_{y2} \\
        b_{1, 3}(t_1)P_{x1} + b_{2, 3}(t_1)P_{x2} \\
        b_{1, 3}(t_1)P_{y1} + b_{2, 3}(t_1)P_{y2} \\
        \vdots \\
        b_{1, 3}(t_{N - 1})P_{x1} + b_{2, 3}(t_{N - 1})P_{x2} \\
        b_{1, 3}(t_{N - 1})P_{y1} + b_{2, 3}(t_{N - 1})P_{y2} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
For computing $S(\mathbf{P})$, a common way is to select the same location of points at both $\mathbf{F}(x_i)$ and
$\mathbf{B}(t_i, \mathbf{P})$. Unfortunately, the distribution of $\mathbf{B}(t_i, \mathbf{P})$ is also based on
$\mathbf{P}$. It implies that this is a non-linear curve fitting problem.

A general method to solve the non-linear least square problem is Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LM). According to this
problem, the parameters $y_i$, $\beta$, and $f(x_i, \beta)$, in LM are equal to $\mathbf{F}(x_i)$, $\mathbf{P}$, and
$\mathbf{B}(t_i, \mathbf{P})$, respectively. Also, $\mathbf{J}(t_i, \mathbf{P})$ can be computed:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{J}(t_i, \mathbf{P}) =
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}(t_i, \mathbf{P})}{\partial \mathbf{P}} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        b_{1, 3}(t_i) & 0 & b_{2, 3}(t_i) & 0 \\
        0 & b_{1, 3}(t_i) & 0 & b_{2, 3}(t_i)
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
and the Jacobian matrix $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{P})$ is:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{P}) =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        b_{1, 3}(t_0) & 0 & b_{2, 3}(t_0) & 0 \\
        0 & b_{1, 3}(t_0) & 0 & b_{2, 3}(t_0) \\
        b_{1, 3}(t_1) & 0 & b_{2, 3}(t_1) & 0 \\
        0 & b_{1, 3}(t_1) & 0 & b_{2, 3}(t_1) \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
        b_{1, 3}(t_{N - 1}) & 0 & b_{2, 3}(t_{N - 1}) & 0 \\
        0 & b_{1, 3}(t_{N - 1}) & 0 & b_{2, 3}(t_{N - 1})
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
After determining all parameters in LM, we can follow the LM flow chart in Fig.~(\ref{f:lm_flow_chart}) to solve it. In
the first step, the initial $\mathbf{P}_1$ is set as the intersection point of tangent line at $\mathbf{P}_0$ and
tangent line at maximum thickness location, and $\mathbf{P}_2$ is set as the intersection point of tangent line at
$\mathbf{P}_3$ and tangent line at maximum thickness location.

Aside from LM, linear least square (LLS) is also a method to solve curve fitting problem. The parameters $\mathbf{A}$,
$\mathbf{x}$, and $\mathbf{b}$ are equal to $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{P})$, $\mathbf{P}$, and $\mathbf{F}$ in LM,
respectively. And then, we design the flow using LLS:
\tikzstyle{rect} = [rectangle, text width = 5cm, minimum height = 0.7cm, draw = black, text centered]
\tikzstyle{diam} = [diamond, text width = 2.5cm, minimum height = 0.7cm, draw = black, text centered]
\tikzstyle{arrow} = [thick, ->, >=stealth]
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 0.7cm, font = \small]
        \node (rect_cpb) [rect] {Compute $\mathbf{b}$.};
        \node (rect_sep) [rect, below = of rect_cpb] {Set $\mathbf{x}_0$.};
        \node (rect_cpa) [rect, below = of rect_sep] {Compute $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x}_0)$.};
        \node (rect_sox) [rect, below = of rect_cpa] {Solve $\mathbf{x}$.};
        \node (diam_chk) [diam, below = of rect_sox] {$\left| \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_0 \right| < \epsilon$ ?};
        \node (rect_sol) [rect, below = of diam_chk] {Get $\mathbf{x}$.};
        \node (rect_rsx) [rect, right of = diam_chk, xshift = 6cm] {Set $\mathbf{x}_0$ = $\mathbf{x}$.};
        \draw [arrow] (rect_cpb) -- (rect_sep);
        \draw [arrow] (rect_sep) -- (rect_cpa);
        \draw [arrow] (rect_cpa) -- (rect_sox);
        \draw [arrow] (rect_sox) -- (diam_chk);
        \draw [arrow] (diam_chk.south) node[anchor = north west]{Yes} -- (rect_sol);
        \draw [arrow] (diam_chk.east) node[anchor = south west]{No} -- (rect_rsx);
        \draw [arrow] (rect_rsx.north) |- (rect_cpa.east);
    \end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

In this method, $\epsilon$ is the error tolerance, and the $\mathbf{x}_0$ is what we guass $\mathbf{x}$ before solving
it. Obviously, if $\mathbf{x}$ is closed to $\mathbf{x}_0$ enough, it is the solution.
